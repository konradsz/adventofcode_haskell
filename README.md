# Advent of Code - in Haskell!
This repository documents my struggles solving Advent of Code problems in Haskell - because what is a better way to learn a new language?

I don't recommend treating the code as a good example; on the contrary, it would probably make experienced Haskeller cry.

## How to compile and run
```
ghc --make solution.hs
./solution input
```
